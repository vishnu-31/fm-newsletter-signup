This is a FrontendMentor challenge to create a mockup page of a newsletter subscribe page.



I have used:
 - Next.js
 - React.js 
 - Tailwind CSS

 in this project.

If you want to run this code locally,

You can clone the repo with

```bash 

git clone https://github.com/vishnu-31/fm-newsletter-signup.git

```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
